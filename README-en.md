# Open wChain Network (OwCN)
**White Paper Draft**

---

## General Description
**Open wChain Network (OwCN)** is an evolution of the original project, **wChainGRPC**, a lightweight experiment to understand and build interactions between applications and blockchain networks using the **JSON-RPC** protocol.

Designed from the outset as a testing and learning tool, OwCN aims to be an **open, modular, and lightweight** blockchain network that developers, researchers, and the community can use to explore the foundations of blockchain technology **without the burden of complexity** of large production systems like Ethereum or Bitcoin Core.

## Development Roadmap

### Q1: Experimental (DEV) — Ongoing
- **Implementation of basic blockchain features** *(checkpoint)*
- Testing and validation of the JSON-RPC protocol
- Modular architecture refinement
- Documentation and use cases
- Community development and open contributions
- Deployment and testing in an internal testnet environment
- Security risk assessment and improvements based on feedback
- Development of multi-language integration
- Preparation of a final report and future development plan

### Q2: Beta (TESTNET) — Coming Soon
- Public testnet launch
- Initial consensus mechanism
- Node synchronization performance improvements
- Attack simulations and network resilience testing
- API integration for the third-party application ecosystem
- Advanced documentation and contribution guidelines

### Q3: Mainnet (Experimental) — Coming Soon
- Experimental mainnet launch
- Optimization of consensus and network stability
- Implementation of advanced security features
- Performance monitoring and evaluation Network
- Developing a long-term development plan
